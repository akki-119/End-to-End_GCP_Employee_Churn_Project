### Tools used: Python, BigQuery, Google Colab, PyCaret, Looker Studio, Google Sheets
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Objective:
Addressing employee retention issues by proactively identifying individuals at risk of leaving the organization.

### Approach:
Implement a pilot program focusing on new employees. Develop an AutoML model trained on historical data to forecast employee churn.

### Deliverables:
- Report with clear recommendations.
- Interactive dashboard for monitoring employee churn metrics.

### Project Workflow:
1. **Database Setup (BigQuery):** Establish a robust database infrastructure on Google BigQuery.
2. **Data Connection (Colab to BigQuery):** Establish connectivity between Python environment (Colab) and BigQuery for seamless data access.
3. **Churn Prediction Model (PyCaret):** Utilize PyCaret to construct a predictive model capable of identifying employees likely to churn.
4. **Data Export (BigQuery):** Export relevant data to BigQuery for further analysis and integration with other tools.
5. **Dashboard Creation (Looker Studio):** Develop an intuitive dashboard using Looker Studio for real-time monitoring and analysis of churn metrics.
6. **Recommendations:** Suggest clear recommendations based on the findings for easy decision-making.
